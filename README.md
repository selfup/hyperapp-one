### To get started:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Visit: [webpack-dev-server](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html)

This will reload as you save new code :smile:

*Now go code something awesome!*

***

### To wipe commit history:

**Make sure you are in the boilerplate root:**

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Then work as normal and don't forget to add the new remote before pushing up!
